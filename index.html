            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <br>I am a Junior at the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!) pursuring a degree in Computer Science. I recently completed an internship at Walt Disney World as a Character Performer. Feel free to ask about the experience! <br><br>
                I graduated from Grovetown High School in Grovetown, Georgia as a part of the class of 2020. I took dual enrollment courses at Augusta University in order to graduate early.<br><br>
                I have been coding for 5 years, mainly focusing in Java and C#. I intend to go into Back-End Development or Cyber Security, as find the idea of doing penetration testing fascinating and I would love to learn more. I have an array of projects in C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python that showcase my aptitude for the field and my eagerness to learn as much as I can.<br><br>
                Fun Fact: I have marched in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade!
